    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div>The term fractal was first coined by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot who defined a fractal as "a rough or fragmented
        geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size
        copy of the whole." In his definition, Mandelbrot described the self-similarity property of fractals,
        meaning that it is an exact (or approximate) copy of part of itself. Fractals can be made by repeating
        a simple process over and over again indefinitely. This recurring loop makes a never-ending pattern that
        is visually appealing.

    <h3>Fractal Dimension</h3>
    <div>The fractal dimension of a fractal roughly gives you a sense of how complex the pattern is. This measure
        is calculated by dividing the logarithm of the number of self-similar pieces the figure has (N) by the
        logarithm of the recipricol of the dilation factor (r). This formula seems random, but by applying
        it to simpler figures, we can see the logic.<br>We know that a line is one dimensional, ie. has a
        dimension of 1. If we take a line and split it into <b>x</b> self-similar
        pieces, the dilation factor would be <b>1/x</b>. These pieces are self-similar simply if they are of equal
        length. If the original line is of length 1, the self-similar pieces are of length 1/x. Applying the dimension
        formula, we get:<br>&emsp;&emsp;dimension = log(N) / log(1/r) = log(x) / log(x) = 1<br>We know that polygons are two dimensional.
        If we take a square and split it into <b>4</b> self-similar squares, each square has a side length equal to
        <b>1/2</b> the length of the original square. Applying the dimension formula, we get:<br>&emsp;&emsp;dimension
        = log(N) / log(1/r) = log(4) / log(2) = log(2<sup>2</sup>) / log(2) = 2*log(2) / log(2) = 2

        <h2>Sierpinski Triangle</h2>
        <div class="flex">
            <div id="fractal1" class="col1">
                <button type="button" id="addTriLayer"  onclick="addTriLayer()">Add Level</button>

            <div class="col2">
                <div id="triTextDiv">N = 1</div>
                <div><br>The Sierpinski Triangle is an example of a fractal whose self-similar property can be easily
                    seen. The figure itself is an exact copy of the three smaller equilateral triangle, whose side
                    lengths are half that of the whole figure's, at the top, bottom right, and bottom left vertices.<br>
                    <br>The process of making this fractal can be explained in these three steps:<br>&emsp;1. Take an
                    equilateral triangle.<br>&emsp;2. Shrink the triangle by a factor of 1/2 (r = 1/2) and place
                    three of these triangles in each of the three vertices of the original triangle.<br>&emsp;3.
                    Repeat step 2 with each of the three newly placed triangles.<br>

                    <br>Oftentimes, there is more than one way to think about how a fractal is made. Another process that
                    creates this same fractal can be described as the following:<br>&emsp;1. Take an
                    equilateral triangle.<br>&emsp;2. Divide the triangle into four smaller congruent triangles.
                    Each smaller triangle should have a side length that is equal to half the original triangle.
                    <br>&emsp;3. Remove the central triangle.<br>&emsp;4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with each of the
                    remaining three triangles.

                    whose side lengths are a third that of the whole figure's, at each of the vertices.<br>
                    <br>The process of making this fractal can be explained in these three steps:<br>&emsp;1. Take a
                    regular hexagon.<br>&emsp;2. Shrink the hexagon by a factor of 1/3 (r = 1/3) and place
                    six of these hexagons in each of the six vertices of the original hexagon.<br>&emsp;3.

                <div><br>This square fractal can also be classified as self-similar. If we ignore the coloring of the
                    squares, the figure is an exact copy of the square rotated 45&#176 that is inscribed in the
                    larger square.<br>
                    <br>The process of making this fractal can be explained in these three steps:<br>&emsp;1. Take a
                    square.<br>&emsp;2. Shrink the square by a factor of &#8730;2 / 2 (r =  &#8730;2 / 2), rotate
                    it clockwise 45&#176, and place it in the center of the original square.<br>&emsp;3.
                    Repeat step 2 with the new square.<br>

                <div><br>Another way to think about this fractal is by considering the coloring as a part of the
                    pattern. This process can be described as:<br>&emsp;1. Take a square and divide it into four
                    purple triangles in each vertex and a white (or empty) rotated square in the center.
                    <br>&emsp;2. Shrink the square by a factor of 1/2 (r =  1/2) and place it in the center of
                    the original figure.<br>&emsp;3. Repeat step 2 with the new figure.<br>
